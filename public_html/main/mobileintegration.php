		<h2>How Can I Unify my Communications?</h2>
	</div>
	<h3>Red Rock's app for mobile and desktop enables you to integrate voice, instant messaging, video, and email into a single cross platform user experience.</h3> 
		<h4>Accession will become the primary means by which your employees communicate.</h4>
	<div class="two-third">
		<h5>Save Time, Do More</h5>
			<ul style="list-style-type:square">
				<li> <strong>Call from anywhere.</strong> Make and receive calls on your mobile as though you were at your desk. With single number convenience, the person you call will see your desk phone number. 
					 Now you can choose who sees your mobile number.  </li>
				<li> <strong>Receive calls on any device.</strong>When someone calls your primary number, the call will appear on one or more of the devices that you&rsquo;ve set up. 
					 This can include your desk phone, your mobile phone, your PC or Mac and tablet devices. You answer the call on whichever device is most convenient for you.</li>
				<li> <strong>Seamlessly transfer calls.</strong> Start a call on Wi-Fi, switch it to cellular if you move out of Wi-Fi coverage. Move a call to your fixed line when you arrive at the office. 
					 Take a call with you by switching it from your desk phone to your mobile, or even to your tablet. Save your mobile minutes for when you&rsquo;re actually mobile </li>
				<li> <strong>Call Manager.</strong>The call manager helps you with all these features. It also makes it easy to mute calls, transfer calls, make three-way calls, place calls on hold, record calls 
					 (where local laws permit) and adjust the microphone or headset volume.  </li>
				<li> <strong>Upgrade your calls</strong> to video If the person you&rsquo;re calling has a compatible service, you can choose to uplift the call to a video call.</li>
			</ul>
		<h5>Powerful Features, Easy to Use</h5>
		<ul style="list-style-type:square">
			<li><strong>Integrate your contacts.</strong> See and access all your contacts &ndash; including the corporate directory &ndash; in any device. Search, call and edit any of your contacts effortlessly 
				and keep them synchronized. Accession Communicator presents you with a consolidated list of contacts from several sources.</li>
			<li><strong>Visual Voicemail.</strong>Easily check your voice, video and fax messages. Your voice messages can even be translated into text so you can read them without dialing in to retrieve them. 
				Listen, delete or respond at the touch of a button. And now there&rsquo;s only one message center to check. Save time, respond faster.</li>
			<li><strong>Conference calls. </strong>It&rsquo;s simple to set up and manage audio conferences from your desktop.</li>
			<li><strong>Chat.</strong>You can use Accession Communicator to send instant messages to other people in your corporate directory who are using the same service, no matter what device they are using.</li>
			<li><strong>Softphone for your PC.</strong>Add a headset to your desktop or laptop then make and receive audio and video calls from your PC just like you would on your desk phone - 
				the person you&rsquo;re calling sees your usual desk phone number, as though you were calling from your desk.

				standard security and privacy measures.</li>
